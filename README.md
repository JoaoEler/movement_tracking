# Webcam Capture Motion Tracker

Simple and quick script I made in about 10 minutes

## Running the script

First off, install opencv with pip

```bash
pip install cv2
```

Now, you can run the scritp with

```bash
python capture.py
```

The script will render a frozen frame so you can select the object with your mouse and press enter or space to proceed (or press c to cancel and select the object again). Quit the application by pressing Q on your keyboard.
